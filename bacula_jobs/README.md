# Bacula / Bareos Backup Monitoring

Complete Monitoring for Bacula or Bareos Backup Jobs. Including Age and State.
Allowed states can be set in WATO. Also the Agent Bakery is supported.

The Plugin uses bconsole to get the states for the backups of the last 30 Days, then parses for the newest one to check the state.
