description:
 This check monitors the status of Bacula / Bareos Backup Systems.

 It uses database queries to obtain the status.

 Prerequisites:

  - MySQL: mysql binary available. Credentials in /root/.my.cnf

  - PostgreSQL: psql binary available, ident auth in pg_hba.conf for the Bacula / Bareos user

 By default, the plugin uses MySQL. Create a bacula.cfg on the agent host
 in the MK_CONFDIR (typically /etc/check_mk) to configure the plugin.
 If you use the Agent Bakery, the config file is generated automatically.
 If you do not use the Agent bakery, copy the plugins/bacula_jobs file to the agents check_mk_agent/plugins dir

 bacula.cfg options:

  - backend_type=mysql # MySQL / MariaDB (default)

  - backend_type=pgsql # PostgreSQL

  - dbname=bacula      # Database name

  - dbuser=bacula      # In case of PostgreSQL, this is also the local user

  - dbhost=localhost   # DB host to connect to
