Checks and Stuff for Check_MK

Since I'm an ex-Member of the Check_MK Team, I work as a Consultant and Programmer for Check_MK Projects.
Here you can find Checks, Script etc. from me, that is not (yet) part of Check_MK official, and may never be but all stuff here
has good quality and is useful.

You will find MKP Files whenever possible, so all stuff can easily be added or removed to/from your System.
